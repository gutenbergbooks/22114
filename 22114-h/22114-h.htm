<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>My object in writing this little book is to show you
how you may prepare and cook your daily food, so as
to obtain from it the greatest amount of nourishment
at the least possible expense; and thus, by skill and
economy, add, at the same time, to your comfort and
to your comparatively slender means. The Recipes
which it contains will afford sufficient variety, from
the simple every-day fare to more tasty dishes for the
birthday, Christmas-day, or other festive occasions.</p>

<p>In order to carry out my instructions properly,
a few utensils will be necessary. Industry, good
health, and constant employment, have, in many instances,
I trust, enabled those whom I now address
to lay by a little sum of money. A portion of this
will be well spent in the purchase of the following
articles:&mdash;A cooking-stove, with an oven at the side,
or placed under the grate, which should be so planned
as to admit of the fire being open or closed at will;
by this contrivance much heat and fuel are economized;
there should also be a boiler at the back of
the grate. By this means you would have hot water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
always ready at hand, the advantage of which is considerable.
Such poor men's cooking-stoves exist, on
a large scale, in all modern-built lodging-houses. Also,
a three-gallon iron pot with a lid to it, a one-gallon
saucepan, a two-quart ditto, a frying-pan, a gridiron,
and a strong tin baking-dish.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cost prices at which the
above-named articles, as well as a few others equally
necessary, may be obtained of all ironmongers:&mdash;</p>

<p>To those of my readers who, from sickness or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
other hindrance, have not money in store, I would
say, strive to lay by a little of your weekly wages to
purchase these things, that your families may be well
fed, and your homes made comfortable.</p>

<p>And now a few words on baking your own bread.
I assure you if you would adopt this excellent practice,
you would not only effect a great saving in your
expenditure, but you would also insure a more substantial
and wholesome kind of food; it would be free
from potato, rice, bean or pea flour, and alum, all of
which substances are objectionable in the composition
of bread. The only utensil required for bread-making
would be a tub, or trough, capable of working a bushel
or two of flour. This tub would be useful in brewing,
for which you will find in this book plain and easy
directions.</p>

<p>I have pointed out the necessity of procuring
these articles for cooking purposes, and with the
injunction to use great care in keeping them
thoroughly clean, I will at once proceed to show
you their value in a course of practical and economical
cookery, the soundness and plainness of which I sincerely
hope you will all be enabled to test in your
own homes.</p>



<h2>COOKERY BOOK.</h2>


<h3><a name="No_1" id="No_1">No. 1. <span class="smcap">Boiled Beef.</span></a></h3>

<p>This is an economical dinner, especially where
there are many mouths to feed. Buy a few pounds
of either salt brisket, thick or thin flank, or buttock
of beef; these pieces are always to be had at a low
rate. Let us suppose you have bought a piece
of salt beef for a Sunday's dinner, weighing about five
pounds, at 6 <span class="sup">1</span>/<span class="sub">2</span><em>d.</em> per pound, that would come to 2<em>s.</em> 8 <span class="sup">1</span>/<span class="sub">2</span><em>d.</em>;
two pounds of common flour, 4<em>d.</em>, to be made into suet
pudding or dumplings, and say 8 <span class="sup">1</span>/<span class="sub">2</span><em>d.</em> for cabbages, parsnips,
and potatoes; altogether 3<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em> This would
produce a substantial dinner for ten persons in family,
and would, moreover, as children do not require much
meat when they have pudding, admit of there being
enough left to help out the next day's dinner, with
potatoes.</p>


<h3><a name="No_2" id="No_2">No. 2. <span class="smcap">How to Boil Beef.</span></a></h3>

<p>Put the beef into your three or four gallon pot,
three parts filled with cold water, and set it on the
fire to boil; remove all the scum that rises to the
surface, and then let it boil gently on the hob;
when the meat has boiled an hour and is about half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
done, add the parsnips in a net, and at the end of
another half hour put in the cabbages, also in a net.
A piece of beef weighing five or six pounds will require
about two hours' gentle boiling to cook it thoroughly.
The dumplings may, of course, be boiled
with the beef, etc. I may here observe that the
dumplings and vegetables, with a small quantity of the
meat, would be all-sufficient for the children's meal.</p>


<h3><a name="No_3" id="No_3">No. 3. <span class="smcap">Economical Pot Liquor Soup.</span></a></h3>

<p>A thrifty housewife will not require that I should
tell her to save the liquor in which the beef has been
boiled; I will therefore take it for granted that the
next day she carefully removes the grease, which
will have become set firm on the top of the broth, into
her fat pot; this must be kept to make a pie-crust,
or to fry potatoes, or any remains of vegetables,
onions, or fish. The liquor must be tasted, and if it
is found to be too salt, some water must be added to
lessen its saltness, and render it palatable. The pot
containing the liquor must then be placed on the fire
to boil, and when the scum rises to the surface it
should be removed with a spoon. While the broth is
boiling, put as many piled-up table-spoonfuls of oatmeal
as you have pints of liquor into a basin; mix
this with cold water into a smooth liquid batter, and
then stir it into the boiling soup; season with some
pepper and a good pinch of allspice, and continue
stirring the soup with a stick or spoon on the fire
for about twenty minutes; you will then be able to
serve out a plentiful and nourishing meal to a large
family at a cost of not more than the price of the
oatmeal.</p>


<h3><a name="No_4" id="No_4">No. 4. <span class="smcap">Potato Soup for Six Persons.</span></a></h3>

<p>Peel and chop four onions, and put them into a
gallon saucepan, with two ounces of dripping fat, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
butter, or a bit of fat bacon; add rather better than
three quarts of water, and set the whole to boil on
the fire for ten minutes; then throw in four pounds
of peeled and sliced-up potatoes, pepper and salt, and
with a wooden spoon stir the soup on the fire for about
twenty-five minutes, by which time the potatoes will
be done to a pulp, and the soup ready for dinner or
breakfast.</p>


<h3><a name="No_5" id="No_5">No. 5. <span class="smcap">Pea Soup for Six Persons.</span></a></h3>

<p>Cut up two and a-half pounds of pickled pork,
or some pork cuttings, or else the same quantity of
scrag end of neck of mutton, or leg of beef, and put
any one of these kinds of meat into a pot with a gallon
of water, three pints of split or dried peas, previously
soaked in cold water over-night, two carrots, four
onions, and a head of celery, all chopped small; season
with pepper, but <em>no</em> salt, as the pork, if pork is used,
will season the soup sufficiently; set the whole to boil
very gently for at least three hours, taking care to
skim it occasionally, and do not forget that the peas,
etc., must be stirred from the bottom of the pot now
and then; from three to four hours' gentle boiling will
suffice to cook a good mess of this most excellent and
satisfying soup. If fresh meat is used for this purpose,
salt must be added to season it. Dried mint
may be strewn over the soup when eaten.</p>


<h3><a name="No_6" id="No_6">No. 6. <span class="smcap">Onion Soup for Six Persons.</span></a></h3>

<p>Chop fine six onions, and fry them in a gallon
saucepan with two ounces of butter or dripping fat,
stirring them continuously until they become of a very
light colour; then add six ounces of flour or oatmeal,
and moisten with three quarts of water; season with
pepper and salt, and stir the soup while boiling for
twenty minutes, and when done, pour it out into a
pan or bowl containing slices of bread.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="No_7" id="No_7">No. 7. <span class="smcap">Broth made from Bones for Soup.</span></a></h3>

<p>Fresh bones are always to be purchased from
butchers at about a farthing per pound; they must
be broken up small, and put into a boiling-pot with a
quart of water to every pound of bones; and being
placed on the fire, the broth must be well skimmed,
seasoned with pepper and salt, a few carrots, onions,
turnips, celery, and thyme, and boiled very gently
for six hours; it is then to be strained off, and put
back into the pot, with any bits of meat or gristle
which may have fallen from the bones (the bones left
are still worth a farthing per pound, and can be sold
to the bone-dealers). Let this broth be thickened
with peasemeal or oatmeal, in the proportion of a large
table-spoonful to every pint of broth, and stirred over
the fire while boiling for twenty-five minutes, by
which time the soup will be done. It will be apparent
to all good housewives that, with a little trouble and
good management, a savoury and substantial meal may
thus be prepared for a mere trifle.</p>


<h3><a name="No_8" id="No_8">No. 8. <span class="smcap">Thick Milk for Breakfast.</span></a></h3>

<p>Milk, buttermilk, or even skim-milk, will serve
for this purpose. To every pint of milk, mix a piled-up
table-spoonful of flour, and stir the mixture while
boiling on the fire for ten minutes; season with a
little salt, and eat it with bread or a boiled potato.
This kind of food is well adapted for the breakfast of
women and children, and is far preferable to a sloppy
mess of tea, which comes to more money.</p>


<h3><a name="No_9" id="No_9">No. 9. <span class="smcap">Oatmeal Porridge for Six Persons.</span></a></h3>

<p>To five pints of skim or buttermilk, add a couple
of onions chopped fine, and set them to boil on the
fire; meanwhile, mix six table-spoonfuls of oatmeal
with a pint of milk or water very smoothly, pour
it into the boiling milk and onions, and stir the porridge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
on the fire for ten minutes; season with salt to
taste.</p>


<h3><a name="No_10" id="No_10">No. 10. <span class="smcap">Ox-cheek Soup.</span></a></h3>

<p>An ox-cheek is always to be bought cheap; let it
be thoroughly washed in several waters, place it whole
in a three gallon boiling-pot filled up with water, and
set it to boil on the fire; skim it well, season with
carrots, turnips, onions, celery, allspice, pepper, and
salt; and allow the whole to boil very gently by the
side of the hob for about three hours and a-half, by
which time the ox-cheek, etc., will be done quite
tender; the cheek must then be taken out on to a
dish, the meat removed from the bone, and after
being cut up in pieces, put back into the soup
again. Next mix smoothly twelve ounces of flour
with a quart of cold water, pour this into the soup,
and stir the whole on the fire, keeping it boiling for
about twenty-five minutes longer; when it will be
ready for dinner. One ox-cheek, properly managed,
will, by attending to the foregoing instructions, furnish
an ample quantity of substantial and nutritious food,
equal to the wants of a large family, for three days'
consumption.</p>


<h3><a name="No_11" id="No_11">No. 11. <span class="smcap">Sheep's-head Broth.</span></a></h3>

<p>Get the butcher to split the sheep's head into halves,
wash these clean, and put them into a boiling-pot
with two gallons of water; set this on the fire to boil,
skim it well, add carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, celery,
thyme or winter savory, season with pepper and salt;
add a pint of Patna rice, or Scotch barley; and all
the whole to keep gently boiling by the side of the fire
for three hours, adding a little water to make up for
the deficiency in quantity occasioned by boiling.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="No_12" id="No_12">No. 12. <span class="smcap">Cow-heel Broth.</span></a></h3>

<p>Put a couple of cow-heels into a boiling-pot, with a
pound of rice, a dozen leeks washed free from grit and
cut into pieces, and some coarsely chopped parsley;
fill up with six quarts of water, set the whole to boil
on the fire, skim it well, season with thyme, pepper,
and salt, and allow the whole to boil very gently on
the hob for about two hours. You will thus provide
a savoury meal at small cost.</p>


<h3><a name="No_13" id="No_13">No. 13. <span class="smcap">Bacon and Cabbage Soup.</span></a></h3>

<p>When it happens that you have a dinner consisting
of bacon and cabbages, you invariably throw away
the liquor in which they have been boiled, or, at the best,
give it to the pigs, if you possess any; this is wrong,
for it is easy to turn it to a better account for your
own use, by paying attention to the following instructions,
viz.:&mdash;Put your piece of bacon on to boil in a
pot with two gallons (more or less, according to the
number you have to provide for) of water, when
it has boiled up, and has been well skimmed, add the
cabbages, kale, greens, or sprouts, whichever may be
used, well washed and split down, and also some parsnips
and carrots; season with pepper, but <em>no</em> salt, as
the bacon will season the soup sufficiently; and when
the whole has boiled together very gently for about
two hours, take up the bacon surrounded with the
cabbage, parsnips, and carrots, leaving a small portion
of the vegetables in the soup, and pour this into a

to roast it. Baste the fowl, while it is being roasted,
with butter, or some kind of grease, and when nearly
done, sprinkle it with a little flour and salt, and allow
the fowl to attain a bright yellow-brown colour before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

<p>Industrious and intelligent boys who live in the

catching small birds at odd times during the winter
months. So, my young friends, when you have been
so fortunate as to succeed in making a good catch of
a couple of dozen of birds, you must first pluck them
free from feathers, cut off their heads and claws, and
pick out their gizzards from their sides with the point
of a small knife, and then hand the birds over to your
mother, who, by following these instructions, will
prepare a famous pudding for your dinner or supper.
First, fry the birds whole with a little butter, shalot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
parsley, thyme, and winter savory, all chopped small,
pepper and salt to season; and when the birds are
half done, shake in a small handful of flour, add
rather better than a gill of water, stir the whole on
the fire while boiling for ten minutes, and when the
stew of birds is nearly cold, pour it all into a good-sized
pudding basin, which has been ready-lined with
either a suet and flour crust, or else a dripping-crust,
cover the pudding in with a piece of the paste, and
either bake or boil it for about an hour and-a-half.</p>

<h3><a name="No_29" id="No_29">No. 29. <span class="smcap">How to make the most of a Pig, after
it is killed.</span></a></h3>

<p>Cottagers sometimes feed a pig for their own
consumption, and, therefore, in the hope that
many of you may have it in your power to do
so, I will give you proper instructions as to the
best way to make the most of it. First, when the pig
is killed, should the hair or bristles be wet, wipe them
dry with a wisp of hay or straw, and having laid it on
the ground upon a narrow bed of dry straw three
inches in thickness, and laid some loose straw all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
over it, set fire to it, and as the upper straw burns
out, lay on another covering of loose straw, and, by
the time this has burnt out, all the hairs of the upper
part of the pig will probably be singed off, if not,
burn a little more straw upon the remaining parts;
and, on turning the pig over, should it be found that
any of the hairs yet remain, let them be singed off
with a lighted wisp of straw. Throw a pail of water
over the pig, and scrape it clean and dry with an old
knife. The next thing to be done, is to insert a stout
stick, pointed at the ends, into the hocks of the hind
legs; fasten a strong cord to the stick, and hoist up
the pig so as to enable you to stand up and finish
your work with ease to yourself. With a sharp knife
rip up the belly, and stretch out the flaps with two
sticks to enable you to throw in some water to cleanse
the pig's inside, having first removed the guts, etc.;
hang up the pluck to cool, and also the chitterlings,
and loose fat; and, after thoroughly wiping the pig,
let it hang in the draught to become quite cold. You
then split the pig in halves, commencing between the
hind quarters; and, when this is done, first cut off the
hocks, then the hams, and the head; next cleverly
remove, slicing away, what is called the spare-rib&mdash;that
is, the lean meat about the ribs&mdash;reaching up about
four inches toward the breast part, and lay the spare-ribs
aside to be sold or reserved for your own use. The
head may be baked as shown in <a href="#No_25">No. 25</a>. The spare-rib
may be dressed as in <a href="#No_27">No. 27</a>.</p>

and a good table-spoonful of allspice, bruise
all these things well together, and thoroughly rub
them over and into the hams, <em>with very clean hands</em>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

<p>When the hams have been well pickled, as shown
in the <a href="#No_30">preceding Number</a>, they must be pressed
between boards with heavy stones to render them
flat; the hams should remain in press for twenty-four
hours; and, at the end of that time, must be well
rubbed all over with peasemeal mixed with a little salt;
they are then to be smoked in a close shed or in the
chimney, burning for that purpose some branches of
juniper or any other wood, and some sawdust. The
smoking must last five days. The hams, when sufficiently
smoked, must be kept in a cool place. They
will not be ripe for cooking before six months after
their curing. Remember that a couple of well-cured
hams, kept in reserve for a case of need, will always
prove a ready means to realize some twenty-five
shillings towards paying the rent, etc.</p>

and to every ten pounds of salt six ounces of saltpetre,
two ounces of salprunella, and eight ounces of sugar;
rub the salt, etc., well into the bacon every morning

time, let the sides of bacon be pressed between boards
with heavy stones placed upon them to keep them
flat; and at the end of twenty-four hours, rub them
over with peasemeal in which there has been mixed a
little salt, and smoke the bacon in the same manner
as <a href="#No_31">the hams</a>; and thus, by timely thriftiness, you will
be provided with a meat dinner for a long while.</p>

pepper and salt, chopped sage, thyme, and winter
savory, and some chopped onions boiled soft in a
little milk or water; mix all these things well together,
and use a tin funnel for filling in the cleansed
guts with the preparation, taking care to tie the one
end of each piece of gut with string, to prevent
waste. The puddings being thus prepared, tie
them in links, each pudding measuring about six
inches in length, and when all are tied, let them
be dropped into a pot containing boiling-water, just
taken off the fire, and allow them to remain in this
until they become set, or slightly firm; the puddings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
must then be carefully lifted out, and hung to a nail

<h3><a name="No_47" id="No_47">No. 47. <span class="smcap">Brown and Polson Pudding.</span></a></h3>

<p>Ingredients, six ounces of Brown and Polson's
prepared Indian corn, two quarts of milk, two ounces
of sugar, a bit of cinnamon or lemon-peel, a pinch of
salt, three eggs. Mix all the above ingredients
(except the eggs) in a saucepan, and stir them on the
fire till they come to a boil; then add the eggs beat
up; mix thoroughly, pour the batter into a pie-dish
greased with butter, and bake the pudding for one
hour. Brown and Polson's prepared Indian corn is
a most excellent and economical article of food, equal
to arrow-root, and will prove, on trial, to be both
substantial and nutritive, and also easy of digestion
to the most delicate stomachs.</p>

<p>Ingredients, two pounds of flour, a halfpenny worth
of yeast, a pinch of salt, one pint of milk or
water. Put the flour into a pan, with your fist
hollow out a hole in the centre of the flour, place
the yeast and salt at the bottom, then add the milk
(which should be lukewarm), and with your clean
hand gradually mix the whole well together, and work
the dough perfectly smooth and elastic. The pan
containing the dough must then be covered over with
a cloth, and in the winter must be placed on a stool
in a corner near the fire, that it may rise, or increase
in size to nearly double its original quantity. When
the dough has risen in a satisfactory manner, which
will take about an hour, dip your hand in some flour
and work it, or rather knead it together, without
allowing it to stick to your hands; divide it into
about twelve equal parts; roll these with flour into
balls, and as you turn them out of hand, drop them
gently into a pot on the fire, half full of <em>boiling</em>
water; allow the water to boil up once as you drop
each dumpling in separately, before you attempt to
put in another, in order to prevent the dumplings
from sticking together, as this accident would produce
a very unsatisfactory result, and spoil your dinner.
Yeast dumplings must not boil too fast, as then they
might boil out of the pot. They will require about
half-an-hour's boiling to cook them; they must be
eaten immediately, with a little butter or dripping,
and salt or sugar.</p>

<h3><a name="No_56" id="No_56">No. 56. <span class="smcap">Baked Beef and Potatoes.</span></a></h3>

<p>The cheapest pieces of beef, suitable for baking or
roasting, consist of the thick part of the ribs, cut from
towards the shoulder, the mouse buttock and gravy
pieces, and also what is commonly called the chuck of
beef, which consists of the throat boned and tied up
with string in the form of a small round. Whichever
piece of beef you may happen to buy, it should be well
sprinkled over with pepper, salt, and flour, and
placed upon a small iron trivet in a baking dish containing
peeled potatoes and about half-a-pint of water,
and either baked in your own oven or else sent to the
baker's. If you bake your meat in your own oven,
remember that it must be turned over on the trivet
every twenty minutes, and that you must be careful
to baste it all over now and then with the fat which
runs from it into the dish, using a spoon for that
purpose. It would be very economical if, when you
have baked meat for dinner, you were always to make
a Yorkshire pudding to be baked under it. There
are baking dishes made with a parting down the
middle which just suit this purpose. In this case
the potatoes are put in one part and the pudding in
the other part.</p>

<p>To make this a cheap dinner, you should buy 6<em>d.</em>

which are to be had cheapest at night when the day's
sale is over. The pieces of meat should be first carefully
overlooked, to ascertain if there be any necessity
to pare away some tainted part, or perhaps a fly-blow,
as this, if left on any one piece of meat, would tend
to impart a bad taste to the whole, and spoil the dish.
You then rub a little flour, pepper, and salt all over
the meat, and fry it brown with a little butter or fat
in the frying-pan; when done, put it with the fat
in which it has been fried into a baking-dish containing
some Yorkshire or suet pudding batter, made as

occur, that you have cold meat at your disposal,
upon which you may exercise your knowledge in
domestic economy. Besides, some of you who are
living close to noblemen and gentlemen's mansions in
the country, or otherwise, may perhaps stand a chance
of now and then receiving a donation of this kind.
And whenever you have any cold meat, I advise you
to cook it up into stews of the various kinds described
in this work, or else make it into a hash as follows:
First, chop two onions fine, and put them to boil
with pepper and salt and a pint of water, in a saucepan
for ten minutes, then throw in the meat cut in
thin slices, mixed with a little flour; boil all together
gently for ten minutes longer, and pour the hash into
a dish containing either some ready boiled potatoes,
or else some slices of toasted bread.</p>

<p>Tripe is not exactly a cheap commodity for food;
yet, as you may feel occasionally inclined to indulge
in a treat of this kind, I will give you instructions to
cook it in the most economical manner. When
you have procured any given quantity of tripe,
cut it up in pieces the size of two inches square, put
these into a saucepan containing skim milk, or milk
and water, enough to swim the tripe; add some
peeled onions, pepper, and salt, and a sprig of thyme,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and boil gently for at least an hour; and when the
tripe is done, eat it with mustard and some well
boiled potatoes.</p>

<h3><a name="No_84" id="No_84">No. 84. <span class="smcap">Sausage Dumplings.</span></a></h3>

<p>Make one pound of flour and two ounces of dripping,
or chopped suet, into a firm paste, by adding
just enough water to enable you to knead the whole
together. Divide this paste into twelve equal parts,
roll each of these out sufficiently large to be able to
fold up one of the beef sausages in it, wet the edge of
the paste to fasten the sausage securely in it, and, as
you finish off each sausage dumpling, drop it gently
into a large enough saucepan, containing plenty of
<em>boiling</em> water, and when the whole are finished, allow
them to boil gently by the side of the fire for one
hour, and then take up the dumplings with a spoon
free from water, on to a dish, and eat them while they
are hot.</p>

<p>Let us suppose, or rather hope, that you may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sometimes have a leg of pork to cook for your dinner;
it will eat all the better if it is scored all over by cutting
the rind, or rather slitting it crosswise, at short
distances, with the point of a sharp knife; it is to be
well sprinkled all over with salt, and allowed to absorb
the seasoning during some hours previously to its being
cooked. Prepare some stuffing as follows:&mdash;Chop
six onions and twelve sage leaves fine, fry these with a
bit of butter, pepper, and salt, for five minutes; then
add six ounces of bread soaked in water; stir all
together on the fire for five minutes, and use this
stuffing to fill up a hole or pocket, which you will
make by running the point of a knife down between
the rind and the flesh of the joint of pork; secure this
by sewing it up, or else fasten it securely in with a
small wooden skewer or twig. The joint of pork, so
far prepared, must then be placed upon a trivet in a
baking-dish containing plenty of peeled potatoes, and,
if possible, a few apples for the children; add half a
pint of water, pepper and salt, and if the joint happens
to be a leg, it will require about two hours to bake it.</p>

now and then make presents of a hare and a few
rabbits to the poor cottagers in their vicinity. And
when you are so fortunate as to have a hare given to
you, this is the way to cook it:&mdash;First, cut the hare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
up into pieces of equal size, then cut up a pound of
bacon into small squares, and fry these in a saucepan
for five minutes; next, add the pieces of hare, and,
stirring them round in the pot with a spoon, fry them
brown; add a good handful of flour, some pepper and
allspice, carrots and onions, and a sprig of winter
savory; moisten the stew with nearly three pints of
water, and stir it all together on the fire till it boils,
and then set it on the hob to continue gently simmering
for about an hour and a-half or two hours; the
jugged hare will then be ready for dinner.</p>

two gallons; let it boil up, and skim it well; then put
in some well-washed split cabbages, a few carrots and
parsnips also split, and a few peppercorns; when the
whole has boiled gently for about an hour and a-half,
throw in a dozen peeled potatoes, and by the time that
these are done, the dinner will be ready. And this is
the way in which to make the most of this excellent
and economical dinner. First, take up the bacon, and
having placed it on its dish, garnish it round with the
cabbages, carrots, parsnips, and potatoes, and then add
some pieces of crust, or thin slices of bread, to the

<h3><a name="No_90" id="No_90">No. 90. <span class="smcap">Economical Vegetable Pottage.</span></a></h3>

<p>In France, and also in many parts of Europe, the
poorer classes but very seldom taste meat in any form;
the chief part of their scanty food consists of bread,
vegetables, and more especially of their soup, which is
mostly, if not entirely, made of vegetables, or, as is
customary on the southern coasts of France, Italy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and Spain, more generally of fish, for making which
kinds of soup see Nos. <a href="#No_4">4</a>, <a href="#No_6">6</a>, <a href="#No_118">118</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The most common as well as the easiest method for
making a good mess of cheap and nutritious soup is
the following:&mdash;If you are five or six in family, put a
three-gallon pot on the fire rather more than half
full of water, add four ounces of butter, pepper and
salt, and small sprigs of winter savory, thyme, and
parsley; and when this has boiled, throw in any portion
or quantity, as may best suit your convenience, of
such of the following vegetables as your garden can
afford:&mdash;Any kind of cabbages cleaned and split, carrots,
turnips, parsnips, broad beans, French beans,
peas, broccoli, red cabbages, vegetable marrow, young
potatoes, a few lettuce, some chervil, and a few sprigs
of mint. Allow all this to simmer by the side of the
hob for about two hours, and then, after taking up the
more considerable portion of the whole vegetables on
to a dish, eat one half, or as much as you may require,
of the soup with bread in it, and make up your dinner
with the whole vegetables and more bread. The remainder
will serve for the next day. Let me persuade
you, my friends, to try and persevere in adopting this
very desirable kind of food, when in your power, for
your ordinary fare. I, of course, intend this remark
more particularly for the consideration of such of my
readers as are or may be located in the country, and
who may have a little garden of their own.</p>

<h3><a name="No_92" id="No_92">No. 92. <span class="smcap">This is the way to Boil Rice.</span></a></h3>

<p>I recommend you to buy Patna rice, as it is the
cheapest; it is best to soak it in water over-night, as
it then requires less time to boil it, and moreover,
when soaked, the rice becomes lighter, from the
fact that the grains separate more readily while boiling.
Put the rice on to boil in plenty of cold water,
stirring it from the bottom of the saucepan occasionally
while it is boiling fast; when the grains separate at
the ends, and thus appear to form the letter X, the
rice will be done; it requires about half an hour's
gentle boiling. When the rice is done, drain it in a
colander, and place it before the fire, stirring it now
and then with a fork.</p>

<h3><a name="No_112" id="No_112">No. 112. <span class="smcap">To make Elder Wine.</span></a></h3>

<p>Ingredients, two gallons of elderberries, two
quarts of damsons, eight pounds of raw sugar, at 4 <span class="sup">1</span>/<span class="sub">2</span><em>d.</em>
per pound, two gallons of water, two ounces of ginger,
one ounce of cloves, and half a pint of fresh yeast.
To make this quantity of elder wine, you must have a
copper, a tub, a large canvas or loose flannel bag, and
a five-gallon barrel. First, crush the elderberries
and damsons thoroughly in the pot or copper in which
they are to be boiled; then add the water, and keep
stirring all together as it boils, until the fruit is well
dissolved; then use a wooden bowl or a basin to
pour the whole into a loose flannel bag, steadily fixed
across two stout sticks, resting safely on two chairs, or,
if you have one, a large coarse sieve instead. When all
the liquor has passed through into the tub, put the dregs
back into the copper, to be boiled up with a couple of
quarts of water, and then to be strained to the other
liquor. The next part of the process is to put the
whole of the elderberry juice back into the clean pot
or copper, with the sugar, and the spice, well bruised
with a hammer; stir all together, on the fire, and allow
the wine to boil gently for half an hour, then pour
it into the clean tub to cool; the half-pint of yeast
must then be added, and thoroughly mixed by stirring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
At the end of two days, skim off the yeast which, by
that time, will have risen to the surface. The elder
wine must now be put into the barrel, and kept in the
cellar with the bung-hole left open for a fortnight; at
the end of this time, a stiff brown paper should be
pasted over the bung-hole, and after standing for a
month or six weeks, the wine will be ready for use.
To be obliged to buy all the ingredients for making
elder wine, would render it a matter of great difficulty&mdash;perhaps,
in some cases, an impossibility; but, remember,
that when living in the country, where in some
parts elderberries grow in the hedge-rows, you may
have them for the trouble of gathering them, in which
case the elder wine would be cheaper, and more easily
within your means.</p>

<p>Scrape and peel the following vegetables:&mdash;six carrots,
six turnips, six onions, three heads of celery, and
three parsnips; slice up all these very thinly, and
put them into a two-gallon pot, with four ounces of

good sprig of thyme, and fill up with water or pot
liquor, if you happen to have any; season with pepper
and salt, and put the whole to boil very gently on the

<h3><a name="No_114" id="No_114">No. 114. <span class="smcap">Pumpkin Porridge.</span></a></h3>

<p>I am aware that pumpkins are not generally grown
in this country as an article of food for the poorer
classes, and more is the pity, for they require but little
trouble to rear, and yield an abundance of nutritious
and cooling food, at a small cost; the chief reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for the short supply is, I imagine, the want of knowledge
for turning the pumpkin to good account as an
article of food. I am now about to supply easy
instruction to convey that knowledge to whomsoever
may stand in need of it. Peel and slice up as much
pumpkin as will produce about eight ounces for each
person, and put this into a boiling pot, with two ounces
of butter, and a quart of water; set the whole to
boil very gently on the fire, until the pumpkin is
reduced to a pulp, and then add half-a-pint of buttermilk,
or skim milk, to every person who is to partake
of the porridge. You then stir the porridge over
the fire for about fifteen minutes longer, taking
care that it does not boil over; season with salt and a
little nutmeg, and eat it with toasted bread for breakfast,
or any other meal.</p>

you may happen to catch when fishing, conger eels
cut in slices, and almost any kind of fish which may
come within reach of your means, are all more or less
fit for making a good mess of soup for a meal. First,
chop fine some onions, and put them into a pot with
enough water to furnish about half a pint for each person

<h3><a name="No_121" id="No_121">No. 121. <span class="smcap">To Fry Fish.</span></a></h3>

<p>For this purpose you must have some kind of fat.
Either lard, butter, or dripping fat, would be excellent;
but they must be bought, and cost a little
money. True; but then, if you can afford yourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a bit of meat occasionally, by dint of good thrift you
should save the fat from the boiled meat, or the dripping
from your baked meats, and thus furnish yourselves
with fat for frying your fish twice a-week; and
let me tell you that by introducing fish as an occasional
part of your daily food, your health, as well as
your pockets, would feel the benefit of such a system
of economy. Suppose, then, that you have bought
some cheap kind of fish, such as herrings, large
flounders, plaice, small soles, or any other small or
flat fish. First of all, let the fish be washed and
wiped dry, and rubbed all over with a little flour.
Next, put about two ounces of fat, free from water,
in a frying-pan on the fire, and, as soon as it is hot,
put the fish in to fry, one or two at a time, according
to their size, as, unless they have room enough in the
frying-pan they do not fry well; this must be carefully
attended to, and when the fish is a little browned on
one side, turn it over with a tin fish-slice, that it may
be fried on the other side also; and, as soon as done,
place the fried fish on a dish and then fry the others.
When all your fish are fried, with what fat remains in
the pan fry some onions, and place them round the fish,
and, by way of adding an extra relish to your meal, just
throw a few table-spoonfuls of vinegar, some pepper
and salt, into the frying-pan, give it a boil up, and
pour this round the fish.</p>

<h3><a name="No_130" id="No_130">No. 130. <span class="smcap">How to Brew your own Beer.</span></a></h3>

<p>The first preparatory step towards brewing is to
gather your necessary plant together in proper working
order, and thoroughly clean. Your plant or
utensils must consist of the following articles, viz.:&mdash;A
thirty-gallon copper, two cooling-tubs capable of
holding each about thirty gallons; a mash-tub of
sufficient size to contain fifty-four gallons, and another
tub of smaller size, called an underback; a bucket or
pail, a wooden hand-bowl, a large wooden funnel, a
mash-stirrer, four scraped long stout sticks, a good-sized
loose-wrought wicker basket for straining the beer,
and another small bowl-shaped wicker basket, called a
tapwaist, to fasten inside the mash-tub on to the inner
end of the spigot and faucet, to keep back the grains
when the wort is being run off out of the mash-tub.
You will also require some beer barrels, a couple
of brass or metal cocks, some vent-pegs, and some
bungs. I do not pretend to assert that the whole of
the foregoing articles are positively indispensable for
brewing your own beer. I merely enumerate what is
most proper to be used; leaving the manner and
means of replacing such of these articles as may be
out of your reach very much to your intelligence in
contriving to use such as you possess, or can borrow
from a neighbour, instead. Spring water, from its
hardness, is unfit for brewing; fresh fallen rain water,
caught in clean tubs, or water fetched from a brook or
river, are best adapted for brewing; as, from the
fact of their being free from all calcareous admixture,
their consequent softness gives them the greater
power to extract all the goodness and strength from
the malt and hops.</p>

<p>In order to ensure having good wholesome beer, it
is necessary to calculate your brewing at the rate of
two bushels of malt and two pounds of hops to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fifty-four gallons of water; these proportions, well
managed, will produce three kilderkins of good beer.
I recommend that you should use malt and hops of
the best quality only; as their plentiful yield of beneficial
substance fully compensates for their somewhat
higher price. A thin shell, well filled up plump with
the interior flour, and easily bitten asunder, is a sure
test of good quality in malt; superior hops are
known by their light greenish-yellow tinge of colour,
and also by their bright, dry, yet somewhat gummy
feel to the touch, without their having any tendency
to clamminess. The day before brewing, let all your
tackle be well scrubbed and rinsed clean, the copper
wiped out, and all your tubs and barrels half filled
with cold water, to soak for a few hours, so as to
guard against any chance of leakage, and afterwards
emptied, and set to dry in the open air, weather permitting;
or otherwise, before the fire. Fasten the
tapwaist inside the mash-tub to the inner end of the
faucet and spigot, taking care to place the mash-tub
in an elevated position, resting upon two benches or
stools. Early in the dawn of morning, light the fire
under your copper, filled with water over-night, and,
as soon as it boils, with it fill the mash-tub rather
more than three-parts full; and as soon as the first
heat of the water has subsided, and you find that you
are able to bear your fingers drawn slowly through it
without experiencing pain, you must then throw in
the malt, stirring it about for ten minutes or so; then
lay some sticks across the mash-tub, and cover it with
sacks or blankets, and allow it to steep for three
hours. At the end of the three hours, let off the
wort from the mash-tub into the underback-tub, which
has been previously placed under the spigot and faucet
ready to receive it; pouring the first that runs out
back into the mash, until the wort runs free from
grains, etc.; now put the hops into the underback-tub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and let the wort run out upon them. Your
copper having been refilled, and boiled again while
the mash is in progress, you must now pour sufficient
boiling water into the grains left in the mash-tub to
make up your quantity of fifty-four gallons; and when
this second mashing shall have also stood some two
hours, let it be drawn off, and afterwards mixed with
the first batch of wort, and boil the whole at two
separate boilings, with the hops equally divided; each
lot to be allowed to boil for an hour and a-half after
it has commenced boiling. The beer is now to be
strained through the loose wicker basket into your
cooling tubs and pans; the more you have of these
the better the beer, from its cooling quickly. And
when the beer has cooled to the degree of water
which has stood in the house in summer-time for
some hours, let it all be poured into your two or
three largest tubs, keeping back a couple or three
quarts in a pan, with which to mix a pint of good
yeast and a table-spoonful of common salt; stir this
mixture well together, keep it in rather a warm part
of the house, and in the course of half an hour or so,
it will work up to the top of the basin or pan. This
worked beer must now be equally divided between
the two or three tubs containing the bulk of the beer,
and is to be well mixed in by ladling it about with a
wooden hand-bowl for a couple of minutes. This
done, cover over the beer with sacks or blankets
stretched upon sticks across the tubs, and leave them
in this state for forty-eight hours. The next thing to
be seen to is to get your barrels placed in proper
order and position for being filled; and to this end
attend strictly to the following directions, viz.:&mdash;First,
skim off the scum, which is yeast, from the top
or surface of the tubs, and next, draw off the beer
through the spigot, and with the wooden funnel
placed in the bung-hole, proceed to fill up the barrels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
not quite full; and, remember, that if a few hops are
put into each before filling in the beer, it will keep
all the better. Reserve some of the beer with which
to fill up the barrels as they throw up the yeast while
the beer is working; and when the yeast begins to
fall, lay the bungs upon the bung-holes, and at the
end of ten days or a fortnight, hammer the bungs in
tight, and keep the vent-pegs tight also. In about
two months' time after the beer has been brewed, it
will be in a fit condition for drinking.</p>


<h3><a name="No_131" id="No_131">No. 131. <span class="smcap">How to Bake your own Bread.</span></a></h3>

<p>Put a bushel of flour into a trough, or a large
pan; with your fist make a deep hole in the centre
thereof; put a pint of good fresh yeast into this
hollow; add thereto two quarts of warm water, and
work in with these as much of the flour as will serve
to make a soft smooth kind of batter. Strew this
over with just enough flour to hide it; then cover up
the trough with its lid, or with a blanket to keep all
warm, and when the leaven has risen sufficiently to
cause the flour to crack all over its surface, throw in
a handful of salt, work all together; add just enough
lukewarm soft water to enable you to work the whole
into a firm, compact dough, and after having kneaded
this with your fists until it becomes stiff and comparatively
tough, shake a little flour over it, and again
cover it in with a blanket to keep it warm, in order to
assist its fermentation. If properly managed, the
fermentation will be accomplished in rather less than
half an hour. Meanwhile that the bread is being
thus far prepared, you will have heated your oven to
a satisfactory degree of heat, with a sufficient quantity
of dry, small wood faggots; and when all the
wood is burnt, sweep out the oven clean and free from
all ashes. Divide your dough into four-pound loaves,
knead them into round shapes, making a hole at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
top with your thumb, and immediately put them out

upon them. In about two hours' time they will be
thoroughly baked, and are then to be taken out of

<p>Peel the potatoes thinly, wash them clean, put
them in the steamer, over <em>boiling</em> water, which must
be kept briskly boiling until the potatoes are
thoroughly done, the length of time depending very
much on their size. I am aware that it is not in the
power of all to possess a potato-steamer, although
one may be purchased at Adams &amp; Son's, in the
Haymarket, for a few shillings; and therefore I will
give you instructions how to boil potatoes.</p>


<h3><a name="No_136" id="No_136">No. 136. <span class="smcap">How to Boil Potatoes.</span></a></h3>

<p>Wash the potatoes clean, and put them on to boil
in a saucepan, with cold water just enough to cover
them; place the saucepan on the hob, close to the
fire, and allow them to remain in that position for a
quarter of an hour, by which time the water will have
gradually reached to the boiling point; the saucepan
should now be allowed to boil until the potatoes are
done through, and then pour off the water; put the
lid on again with a cloth on the top, place the saucepan
close to the fire for about five minutes, and when
you turn them out on their dish you will find that
you have a well-boiled, mealy potato before you.</p>

<p>You do not require that I should tell you that
when you have no oven you can easily roast your potatoes
by placing them on the hobs, bars, and under
the fire-grate; and if you are attentive to their being
well roasted, by turning them about now and then,
so that they may be done all over alike, you need not
be deprived of a baked potato for the want of an
oven. When the potatoes are roasted, slightly squeeze
each separately in a cloth, to make them mealy, then
split them open; season them with a bit of butter, or
dripping, a little bit of chopped shalot, pepper, and
salt, and this will afford you a nice relish for supper.</p>


<h3><a name="No_138" id="No_138">No. 138. <span class="smcap">How to Fry Potatoes.</span></a></h3>

<p>Peel, split, and cut the potatoes into slices of <em>equal</em>
thickness, say the thickness of two penny pieces; and
as they are cut out of hand, let them be dropped into
a pan of cold water. When about to fry the potatoes,
first drain them on a clean cloth, and dab them all
over, in order to absorb all moisture; while this has
been going on, you will have made some kind of fat
(entirely free from water or gravy, such as lard, for
instance) very hot in a frying-pan, and into this drop
your prepared potatoes, only a good handful at a
time; as, if you attempt to fry too many at once,
instead of being crisp, as they should be, the potatoes
will fry flabby, and consequently will be unappetising.
As soon as the first lot is fried in a satisfactory manner,
drain them from the fat with a skimmer, or spoon,
and then fry the remainder; and when all are fried,
shake a little salt over them.</p>

burning, which, by imparting a bitter taste, would
spoil them; when all are fried of a very light brown
colour, season with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>In France, haricot beans form a principal part in
the staple articles of food for the working-classes, and
indeed for the entire population; it is much to be desired
that some effectual means should be adopted,
for the purpose of introducing and encouraging the
use of this most excellent vegetable among the people
of England as a general article of daily food, more especially
in the winter. If this desideratum could be
accomplished, its beneficial result would go far to
assist in rendering us in a measure independent of
the potato crop, which, of late years, has proved so
uncertain. I am aware that haricot beans, as well as
lentils, as at present imported and retailed as a mere
luxury to such as possess cooks who know how to
dress them, might lead to the rejection of my proposal
that they should, or could, be adopted as food by the
people; but I see no reason why haricot beans should
not be imported to this country in such quantities as
would enable the importers to retail them at a somewhat
similar low price as that in which they are sold
at in France. In that case, they would become cheap
enough to come within the reach of the poorest.

be eventually realized, I will here give you instructions
how to cook haricot beans to the greatest advantage.</p>

pounds of moist sugar, and half an ounce of citric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
acid, or one pint of lemon juice; boil all together
until reduced to a thick syrup&mdash;that is, when it begins
to run rather thick from the spoon without resembling
treacle; as soon as the syrup has reached this stage,
remove it from the fire, and pour it into a jug to become
quite cold. This syrup will keep good for any
length of time, if bottled and corked down tight, and
kept in a cool place. A tea-spoonful taken occasionally
will soon relieve the most troublesome
cough.</p>

<p>This cordial may also be prepared in winter, using
for the purpose black currant jam, or preserved black
currant juice, instead of the juice of fresh-gathered
currants.</p>

<h2><a name="ECONOMICAL_AND_SUBSTANTIAL_SOUP" id="ECONOMICAL_AND_SUBSTANTIAL_SOUP"></a>ECONOMICAL AND SUBSTANTIAL SOUP
FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE POOR.</h2>


<p>I am well aware, from my own experience, that the
charitable custom of distributing wholesome and nutritious
soup to poor families living in the immediate
neighbourhood of noblemen and gentlemen's mansions
in the country, already exists to a great extent;
yet, it is certainly desirable that this excellent practice
should become more generally adopted, especially
during the winter months, when their scanty means
of subsistence but insufficiently yield them food
adequate in quantity to sustain the powers of life in
a condition equal to their hard labour. To afford the
industrious well-deserving poor a little assistance in
this way, would call forth their gratitude to the givers,
and confer a blessing on the needy. The want of
knowing how to properly prepare the kind of soup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
best adapted to the purpose has, no doubt, in a great
measure, militated against its being more generally
bestowed throughout the kingdom; and it is in order
to supply that deficient knowledge, that I have determined
on giving easy instructions for its preparation.</p>


<h3><a name="No_239" id="No_239">No. 239. <span class="smcap">How to Prepare a Large Quantity
of Good Soup for the Poor.</span></a></h3>

<p>It is customary with most large families, while
living in the country, to kill at least some portion of
the meat consumed in their households; and without
supposing for a moment that any portion of this is
ever wasted, I may be allowed to suggest that certain
parts, such as sheep's heads, plucks, shanks, and
scrag-ends, might very well be spared towards making
a good mess of soup for the poor. The bones left
from cooked joints, first baked in a brisk oven for a
quarter of an hour, and afterwards boiled in a large
copper of water for six hours, would readily prepare a
gelatinized foundation broth for the soup; the bones,
when sufficiently boiled, to be taken out. And thus,
supposing that your copper is already part filled with
the broth made from bones (all the grease having
been removed from the surface), add any meat you
may have, cut up in pieces of about four ounces
weight, garnish plentifully with carrots, celery, onions,
some thyme, and ground allspice, well-soaked split
peas, barley, or rice; and, as the soup boils up, skim
it well occasionally, season moderately with salt, and
after about four hours' gentle and continuous boiling,
the soup will be ready for distribution. It was the
custom in families where I have lived as cook, to
allow a pint of this soup, served out with the pieces
of meat in it, to as many as the recipients' families
numbered; and the soup was made for distribution
twice every week during winter.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="No_240" id="No_240">No. 240. <span class="smcap">Another Method for making
Economical Soup.</span></a></h3>

<p>In households where large joints of salt beef, or
pork, are cooked almost daily for the family, the
liquor in which they have been boiled should be
saved, all grease removed therefrom, and put into the
copper with a plentiful supply of carrots, parsnips,
celery, and onions, all cut in small pieces, the whole
boiled and well skimmed till the vegetables are done;
the soup is then to be thickened with either oatmeal,
peasemeal, or Indian corn meal, seasoned with pepper
and ground allspice, and stirred continuously until it
boils up again; it must then be skimmed, and the best
pieces of meat selected from the stock-pot should be
kept in careful reserve, to be added to the soup, and
allowed to boil therein for half an hour longer.</p>


<h3><a name="No_241" id="No_241">No. 241. <span class="smcap">How to make Fish Soup in Large
Quantities for Distribution to the Poor.</span></a></h3>

<p>This kind of soup, it will be easily understood, is
applicable only on the sea-coast, and wherever fish is
to be had very cheap. Chop fine a dozen onions,
some thyme, and winter savory, and put these into a
copper, or some large pot, with about six gallons of
water, one pound of butter, pepper and salt enough to
season; allow the whole to boil for ten minutes, then
thicken the broth with about four pounds of oatmeal,
peasemeal, or flour; stir the soup continuously until it
boils, and then throw in about fifteen pounds of fish
cut up in one-pound size pieces, and also some
chopped parsley; boil all together until the fish is done,
and then serve out the soup to the recipients. All
kinds of fish, except sprats, herrings, and pilchards,
are equally well adapted for making fish soup, but
codfish, cod's heads, skate, eels, etc., and all glutinous
fish, suit the purpose best.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;"/>

<p class="ad"><em>The Lancet</em>, by its resumed inquiries upon the subject of adulterations,
has again called attention of the Public to a variety of articles of daily use.</p>

<p class="ad">To Mustard great prominence has been given, from the fact that thirty-three
samples were examined. The Report states that <em>four</em> only were
found to be <em>genuine</em>: of which, <em>two</em> samples were of the manufacture of J.
and J. <span class="smcap">Colman</span>, being respectively "Colman's Genuine London Mustard,
Warranted Pure," and "Colman's Brown Mustard, Warranted Pure."</p>

<p class="ad">We also learn that manufactured Mustard extends from the <em>pure</em> and
<em>genuine</em> to the <em>injurious combination</em> exposed in <em>The Lancet</em> (see 27th Sample
examined); to which disclosure the attention of Medical Men is invited
(whether practising privately or in Hospitals and Infirmaries) when
prescribing Mustard as a remedial agent. The fact is also equally important
to the Vendor and his customer, the Public.</p>

<p class="ad">And further, as to <em>quality</em>&mdash;<em>The Lancet</em>, in substance, reports that
<em>genuine Mustard</em> will be as <em>varied</em> in strength, pungency, and flavour, as are
the known differences between the finest and most inferior qualities of
seed; it results, then, that <em>genuine</em> does not necessarily imply high
quality.</p>

<p class="ad">J. and J. <span class="smcap">Colman</span> submit, that in their <em>Pure Mustards</em> nothing that
known skill and improved machinery can obtain from finest seed remains
unsecured, and, whether for prompt and specific <em>medical</em> effects, or as a
table condiment, these Mustards are equally valuable.</p>

<p class="ad">J. and J. <span class="smcap">Colman</span> offer to the Public not only "Genuine" and "Pure"
Mustard in the highest perfection, but also their other varieties of Mustard
Condiments, known as "Double Superfine," "Superfine," "Fine," etc., in
which delicacy, flavour, and strength will be found in agreeable combination.
These Mustards may be obtained of any Grocer, Chemist, or Italian Warehouseman
in the kingdom; and when sold in tins or packets, J. and J.
<span class="smcap">Colman</span>'s <em>trade mark</em>, the "Bull's Head," is a guarantee upon which the
Public may rely.</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: smaller;">(<em>Trade Mark.</em>)</p>

<p class="center">Discovered and named by DR. J. COLLIS BROWNE, M.R.C.S.L.,<br/>
Ex-Army Medical Staff.</p>

<p class="ad">The question asked by invalids, families, and households is, What is the
best medicine to give in the above diseases, and what to have always ready?
Medical testimony, the reply of thousands of sufferers and invalids, is confirmatory
of the invaluable relief afforded by this remedy above all others.</p>

<p class="ad">CHLORODYNE is a liquid taken in drops according to age. It invariably
relieves pain of whatever kind; creates a calm, refreshing sleep;
allays irritation of the nervous system when all other remedies fail; leaving
no bad effects, like opium or laudanum, and can be taken when none other
can be tolerated. Its value in saving life in infancy is not easily estimated;
a few drops will subdue the irritation of Teething, prevent and
arrest Convulsions, cure Whooping Cough, Spasms, and Flatus at once.</p>

<p class="ad">Among invalids it allays the pain of Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Gout,
etc. It soothes the weary achings of Consumption, relieves the Soreness
of the Chest, Cough, and Expectoration; and cures all Chest Affections,
such as Asthma, Bronchitis, Palpitation, etc. It checks Diarrh&oelig;a, Alvine
Discharges, or Spasms, and Colics of the Intestines, etc.</p>

<p class="ad">The extensive demand for this remedy, known as Dr. <span class="smcap">J. Collis
Browne's Chlorodyne</span>, by the Medical Profession, Hospitals, Dispensaries&mdash;Civil,
Military, and Naval&mdash;and Families especially, guarantees that
this statement of its extreme importance and value is a <em>bona fide</em> one, and
worthy the attention of all.</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: larger;">EXTRACTS OF MEDICAL OPINIONS.</p>

<p class="ad">From <span class="smcap">W. Vesalius Pettigrew</span>, M.D.&mdash;"I have no hesitation in stating
that I have never met with any medicine so efficacious as an anti-spasmodic
and sedative. I have used it in Consumption, Asthma, Diarrh&oelig;a,
and other diseases, and am most perfectly satisfied with the results."</p>

<p class="ad">From <span class="smcap">Dr. M'Milman</span>, of New Galloway, Scotland.&mdash;"I consider it the
most valuable medicine known."</p>

<p class="ad"><span class="smcap">G. Hayward</span>, Esq., Surgeon, Stow-on-ye-Wold.&mdash;"I am now using Dr.
J. Collis Browne's Chlorodyne with marvellous good effects in allaying inveterate
sickness in pregnancy."</p>

<p class="ad"><span class="smcap">Dr. M'Grigor Croft</span>, late Army Staff, says:&mdash;"It is a most valuable
medicine."</p>

<p class="ad"><span class="smcap">J. C. Baker</span>, Esq., M.D., Bideford.&mdash;"It is without doubt the most
valuable and certain anodyne we have."</p>

<p class="ad"><span class="smcap">Dr. Gibbon</span>, Army Medical Staff, Calcutta.&mdash;"Two doses completely
cured me of Diarrh&oelig;a."</p>

<p class="ad">From <span class="smcap">G. V. Ridout</span>, Esq., Surgeon, Egham.&mdash;"As an astringent in
severe Diarrh&oelig;a, and an anti-spasmodic in Colic, with Cramps in the Abdomen,
the relief is instantaneous. As a sedative in Neuralgia and Tic-Doloreux
its effects were very remarkable. In Uterine Affections I have
found it extremely valuable."</p>

<p class="ad">CAUTION.&mdash;Beware of Spurious Compounds or Imitations of "Chlorodyne."
Dr. Browne placed the Recipe for making "Chlorodyne" in the
hands of Mr. Davenport ONLY; consequently, there can be no other
Manufacturer. The genuine bears the words, "Dr. J. Collis Browne's

<p class="ad">This excellent FAMILY PILL is a Medicine of long-tried
efficacy for purifying the blood, and correcting all Disorders of the Stomach
and Bowels. Two or three doses will convince the afflicted of its salutary effects. The
stomach will speedily regain its strength; a healthy action of the liver, bowels, and
kidneys will rapidly take place; and renewed health will be the quick result of taking
this medicine, according to the directions accompanying each box.</p>

<p class="ad">PERSONS OF A FULL HABIT, who are subject to headache, giddiness, drowsiness,
and singing in the ears, arising from too great a flow of blood to the head, should never be
without them, as many dangerous symptoms will be entirely carried off by their
timely use; and for elderly people, where an occasional aperient is required, nothing
can be better adapted.</p>

<p class="ad">For FEMALES these Pills are truly excellent, removing all obstructions, the distressing
headache so prevalent with the sex, depression of spirits, dulness of sight,
nervous affections, blotches, pimples, and sallowness of the skin, and give a healthy
juvenile bloom to the complexion.</p>

<p class="ad">This preparation is one of the benefits which the Science
of modern Chemistry has conferred upon mankind; for during the first twenty
years of the present century to speak of a cure for the Gout was considered a romance;
but now the efficacy and safety of this Medicine is so fully demonstrated, by unsolicited
testimonials from persons in every rank of life, that public opinion proclaims
this as one of the most important discoveries of the present age.</p>

<p>My object in writing this little book is to show you
how you may prepare and cook your daily food, so as
to obtain from it the greatest amount of nourishment
at the least possible expense; and thus, by skill and
economy, add, at the same time, to your comfort and
to your comparatively slender means. The Recipes
which it contains will afford sufficient variety, from
the simple every-day fare to more tasty dishes for the
birthday, Christmas-day, or other festive occasions.</p>

<p>To those of my readers who, from sickness or
other hindrance, have not money in store, I would
say, strive to lay by a little of your weekly wages ...
that your families may be well fed, and your homes
made comfortable.</p>
